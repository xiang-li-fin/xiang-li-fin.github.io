Welcome to my webpage.

I am Xiang Li, a PhD candidate in Finance at Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University Rotterdam. I expect to graduate in 2026 and I am on the 2025/2026 job market.

My research explores how finance shapes real economic outcomes, with a focus on innovation, entrepreneurship, and household finance.
